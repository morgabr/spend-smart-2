### Session: Project Infrastructure Setup (Items 6-8)

**Completed Tasks:**

- ✅ Item 6: Set up CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy)
- ✅ Item 7: Write initial README and contribution guidelines
- ✅ Item 8: Set up issue templates and project board

**Key Accomplishments:**

#### CI/CD Pipeline Setup

- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `ci.yml`: Continuous integration with build, test, and lint checks
  - `security.yml`: CodeQL analysis and dependency vulnerability scanning
  - `deploy.yml`: Automated deployment notifications and health checks
- Configured PostgreSQL service for testing in CI environment
- Set up parallel testing for frontend and backend components

#### Render.com Deployment Configuration

- Created `render.yaml` with full staging and production environment setup
- Configured separate databases for staging (`spend-smart-db-staging`) and production
  (`spend-smart-db-prod`)
- Set up auto-deployment triggers:
  - `develop` branch → staging environment
  - `main` branch → production environment
- Configured environment variables for different deployment stages
- Enabled mock external APIs for staging environment

#### Documentation and Guidelines

- **README.md**: Complete project overview with setup instructions, architecture details, and
  deployment info
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Comprehensive development workflow, coding standards, and contribution
  process
- **GitHub Issue Templates**: Structured bug reports and feature requests with proper validation
- **Pull Request Template**: Detailed checklist for code review and quality assurance
- **Project Board Setup**: Documentation for GitHub Projects configuration with automation rules

#### Security and Quality Assurance

- Implemented CodeQL security scanning for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Added dependency review for pull requests
- Configured automated security alerts and vulnerability detection
- Set up code quality checks with ESLint and TypeScript validation

**Architecture Decisions:**

- **Branch Strategy**: `main` (production) ← `develop` (staging) ← `feature/*` (development)
- **Environment Separation**: Complete isolation of staging and production with separate databases
- **Deployment Strategy**: Automated deployment via GitHub Actions with Render.com integration
- **Testing Strategy**: Parallel execution of frontend and backend tests with PostgreSQL service

**Next Steps:** Ready to proceed with core application development starting with backend
infrastructure (Items 9-11).

### Project Rule Update

- Added a new project rule: All commits must be made using the Commit feature in Cursor, to ensure
  that commit messages are AI-generated and thorough. Direct command-line commits are not permitted.

## YYYY-MM-DD

- Project initialized.
- Set up project planning and checklist.
- Established workflow for detailed record-keeping.
