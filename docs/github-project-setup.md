## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Project Board

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Team planning" template
5. Name it "SpendSmart Development"
6. Set description: "Main project board for SpendSmart development"

### 2. Configure Columns

### 5. Import Issues from TODO.md

Create GitHub issues for major TODO items and link them to the project board.

### 6. Team Access

- Add team members with appropriate permissions
- Set up notifications for project updates

## Best Practices

### Issue Management

- Use issue templates for consistent formatting
- Link issues to project board items
- Close issues when work is complete
- Use milestones for sprint planning

### PR Management

- Link PRs to related issues
- Use draft PRs for work in progress
- Require reviews before merging
- Auto-close issues when PRs are merged

### Project Tracking

- Update project status regularly
- Review sprint progress weekly
- Archive completed items monthly
- Track velocity and burndown

## Integration with TODO.md

The project board should sync with our TODO.md file:

- Major TODO items become GitHub issues
- Issues are organized by sprint/milestone
- Progress is tracked in both places
- Project board shows current sprint focus

## Reporting and Metrics

### Sprint Reports

- Velocity tracking
- Burndown charts
- Completion rates
- Blocked item analysis

### Team Metrics

- Individual contribution tracking
- Review cycle times
- Bug resolution rates
- Feature delivery timelines

**Note**: This setup requires repository admin access to implement fully. The project board will be
created manually following these guidelines.
